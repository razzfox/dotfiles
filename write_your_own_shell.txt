Write your own shell:
features like: https://github.com/skx/sysadmin-util
If globbing fails, it should output error and fail.
Test char brackets should not exist. That's not scripting.
get stuff from experimental
Essentially a rewrite of a shell for how people expect a shell to work coming from a desktop experience. Eventually use fish-shell like history (displayed below) and bash-completion like selection. (Can it be scraped from man pages?)
---
always save logs, including from scripts, except functions go into function files.
variables go into variable file and always update environment. 
always append, no limit, ignore dups.
create a command for turinng the last command(s) into a function and create an ncurses screen to select history.
Enable globbing that adds whole filename to args, based on cwd.----
alias l.='ls -d .*' 2>/dev/null
----
glob comes with echo and confirmation before running
----
built-in utilities for renaming (massren) and trash can behavior, safe renaming.
